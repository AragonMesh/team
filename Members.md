## Daniel Constantin — Dev Lead

I used to work as a full-stack dev where we tackled the scalability of our platform. We built a new architecture with horizontal scaling in mind using micro-services (with FeathersJS, Docker, K8s and PostgresQL) and micro-frontends (with React, Redux and Material-UI) which ended up being socially scalable as well, allowing multiple autonomous teams to work in parallel.
Although the tech was amazing and I had the freedom to move around different parts of the stack, I felt like the potential of the tech was limited by being closed source and by competing with other businesses instead of collaborating - considering that business is a positive-sum game. Besides being inefficient it made me really unhappy because most of our value was captured by big corporations (which could afford our services) therefore rising the entry barrier of new players. While trying to make my voice heard, proposing changes towards a sustainable open-source ecosystem, I realized how opaque and rigid our governance model was. Luckily, this was around the time I went down the crypto rabbit hole. Now I’m enthusiastic about Web3 & lowering the transaction cost of human coordination.

## Gabriel Garcia — Dev

I’m a developer who has experience with C, Python and Javascript (mostly backend). I have a general knowledge of Solidity and how the EVM works and I'm always learning something. Learning never ends. I like to have a balance routine around work which include healthy diet, meditation and exercise. My goal is to create an impact in society and I think Aragon's mission is deeply align with that purpose. I believe in the future of the project and will put all my effort to expand the adoption of this technology.

## dappLion — Dev

**Socials**: [GitHub](https://github.com/dapplion)

Former aerospace engineer, I dropped it all to pursue software engineering after discovering Ethereum. I was fortunate early on to join DAppNode where I have been working for 1.5 years helping to decentralize the infrastructure layer. My responsibilities ranged from developing front-end, back-end, CI, and SDK solutions mostly from scratch. Also, I have been able to contribute to other amazing projects such as Giveth, Swarm City and The Commons Stack. Now, I couldn't be more excited to find myself in the middle of an open-source, blockchain-based vibrant ecosystem working on future technology.

**Commitment**: Part time
