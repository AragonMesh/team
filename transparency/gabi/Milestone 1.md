## Description

In this period I started getting involve step-by-step with the team. The first week I tackled an issue in aragon-cli. The second week I helped Chris with a proposal of new tutorials for Aragon by researching and proposing ideas. I started attending the daily meetings. Right now I’m working to improve local storage low limits for [aragon.js-wrapper](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/133)
