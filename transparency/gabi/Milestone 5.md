## Description

This week I started working on the wallet provider but I had to pass the task to Jeremy so I could focus on aragon CLI. I aimed to sprint deliverables. Task I accomplished:

Provide support on aragon chat and solve issues related: #307
Publish new package create-aragon-app. Repo, PR and issue related. Try to solve #275
Start working on this issues: #263
Discuss and co-write part of Flock proposal related to aragon CLI
Meetings & team communication

The last week of this sprint I'll focus on delivery and polish what we committed
