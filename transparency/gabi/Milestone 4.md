## Description

In this period I focused to fix aragonCLI's most relevant bugs, prioritizing issues that were downgrading the devX. The main tasks I accomplished:

- Solved this issues with aragonCLI [#273](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/273), [#274](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/274), [#285](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/285) and [#290](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/290)
- Fixed react-kit boilerplate in this [PR](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-kit-boilerplate/pull/21)
- Worked to fix [wallet-provider](https://github.com/jvluso/aragon.js/tree/wallet-provider-2/packages/aragon-wallet-provider) but didn't solve it yet
- Reviewed Tennagraph third milestones for Nest
- Meetings & team communication

Now my next goal is keep aragonCLI bug free and start building new features aligned with AragonDAC mission
