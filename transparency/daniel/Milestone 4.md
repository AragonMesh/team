## Description

In this period I've been mostly reading into different parts of the stack that I found confusing, properly diving in, with the goal of improving my velocity:

- Looked into [deployments](https://github.com/aragon/deployments) and published the counter app to rinkeby (as a test)

- Looked into [apm.js](https://github.com/aragon/apm.js)

- Looked into ENS

- Read AGP-1 and AIP-1

- Looked into how we calculate the transaction paths

- Helped with some reviews, planning, etc.

Hours logged: 33.25

Requested rate: $50/hr

Total Pay: 1662.5

From the [last milestone](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b6cb8da11875f2dc87ff150/milestones/5bf2c018aad06c0b7db01804) which did not go through: $1662.5

In this period (18-28) I've been:

- Coordinating with the team on internal processes and communication with A1

- Doing some prioritization and grooming of the aragon.js backlog

- Exploring a [strategy for refactoring aragon.js](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/215)

- Starting with tests for the aragon.js transaction pathing

- Fixing and reviewing a couple of PRs on the aragon.js and the aragon-cli

Hours logged: 36.75

Requested rate: $50/hr

Total Pay: $1687.5

Both milestones: $3500
