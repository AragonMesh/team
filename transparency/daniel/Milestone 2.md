## Description

This past week and a half I've been focusing on:

-fixing my opened PRs and getting them merged [aragon.js#147](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/pull/147), [aragon.js#161](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/pull/161)

-investigating an error encountered when following the hack.aragon.org tutorial [aragon-cli#215](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/215) and fixing it

[aragon-react-boilerplate#27](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-boilerplate/pull/27)

-looking into an error me and Chris had caused by an old installation of `aragon-cli`: [aragon-cli#214](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/214)

-reading through the dao kits and the cli source code to get a better understanding of how things work

-attending the daily check-ins and planning

A total of 17.75 hours were logged over this pay cycle at the requested rate of €25/hr for a total of €443
