## Description

This was my first contact with aragon ecosystem. In this period I've managed to understand the code and toolchain from aragon cli and I have written my first tests.

Started work on (WIP):

- [Written tests for ipfs start/stop/install/uninstall commands (cli)](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/1279)
- [Written tests for ipfs daemon, config and misc (toolkit)](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/1280)

Opened these PRs:

- [Increased test coverage to cli and toolkit packages #1298](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/pull/1298)
